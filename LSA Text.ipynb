    "\"FAANG Stocks REVIEWED BY WILL KENTON   Updated Mar 18, 2019 FAANG is an acronym for the market's five most popular and best-performing tech stocks, namely Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google. FAANG was born out of the original acronym, FANG, which did not have Apple when CNBC’s Jim Cramer coined the term in Feb 2013. \\\"Put money to work in the companies that represent the future,\\\" Cramer told audiences. \\\"Put money to work in companies that are totally dominant in their markets, and put money to work in stocks that have serious momentum.\\\" Cramer's call on FANG minted profits for investors. Research firm Morningstar calculated that the original four companies, excluding Apple, in the acronym had earned 691% in profits for investors between June 2013 to August 2018.  What are FAANG Stocks? Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOG) are the five technology giants trading publicly in the market. Investors grouped these companies into one acronym to capture the collective impact that these companies have on the markets. As of March 2019, the market capitalization of these companies was equal to $3.1 trillion.  The sizeable worth of these five tech companies is a result of prominent money managers pouring money into their stocks. Funds like Berkshire Hathaway, Soros Fund Management, Renaissance Technologies, and many others have added FAANG stocks to their portfolio as growth and momentum stocks. The five tech companies have rewarded investors with blockbuster earnings through their forays into new markets, making them among the most highly-valued in the world from a price to earnings perspective. There has been triple digit growth in their stock prices. For example, Apple's share price jumped by 246 percent between January 2013 and August 2018. In addition to the sizable worth of these five tech companies, their growth spurts have also seen the majority of the prominent money managers in the United States increase their stake in FAANG stocks for their funds.   Each of the FAANG stocks trade on the Nasdaq exchange and is included in the S&P 500 Index. Since the S&P 500 is a broad representation of the market, the movement of the market mirrors the index's movement. Together, the FAANGs make up one percent of the S&P 500. But investor enthusiasm for the stocks ensures that their impact on the markets is outsized. In August 2018, they were responsible for 38 percent of the index's gain from lows in February. The S&P market cap in total is 70 percent to 80 percent of the total U.S. stock market capitalization, and the FAANGs, by order of market cap, rank 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 31st and 8th (and 9th) on the index (As of the end of 2018). Alphabet’s Google has two classes of shares trading on the public markets, hence the 9th and 10th rank.  Those rankings mean that a collective up (or down) movement in these tech shares will lead to an increase (or decrease) in the S&P 500 index, and in turn, a rise (or fall) in the market. Clearly, one can see how the FAANG stocks greatly influence the direction of the stock markets. From 2014 to 2016, the year-end earnings generated by each of the five companies has steadily increased, save for Apple Inc.’s 14.43 percent fall in earnings from 2015 to 2016 owing to a drop in revenue – Apple’s first revenue decline in 15 years.  KEY TAKEAWAYS FAANG stocks are growth stocks of five dominant technology companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. FAANG stocks are considered to have majorly contributed to the stock market's rally 2013 onwards. Is There a FAANG Bubble? Concerns about a bubble in FAANG stocks first emerged in 2018, when technology stocks, which had been driving gains in the stock market, began losing steam. In November of the same year, when several FAANG stocks lost more than 20% of their valuations, they were declared to be in bear territory. By some estimates, FAANG stocks lost more than a trillion dollars from their peak valuations as a result of the steep drop in the markets in November 2018.  Attempting to explain the valuation and spectacular performance of the FAANGs in the preceding years, commentators have been likened them to tech stocks before the 2000 dotcom bust, which saw a lot of overvalued tech companies crash, sending the global markets to a downward spiral. During 2018, FAANG stocks were buffeted by various problems, from regulatory and privacy issues for Google and Facebook to investor concerns about their balance sheets. An example of the latter problem is streaming company Netflix, which has had a negative free cash flow for most of its existence.  Some analysts have pointed out the difference between the dot com bust and the current crop of tech companies, stating that there is plenty room for the current tech class to grow as areas of cloud computing, social media, e-commerce, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and big data are still being explored and developed. In Netflix's case, analysts say the pioneering streaming behemoth is staking out its position in the market.\",\n",
    "\"These FAANG stocks are soaring—and some analysts say they have even more room to run Lizzy Gurdus\t| @lizzygurdus Published 9:00 AM ET Wed, 13 March 2019 CNBC.com  \tThese FAANG stocks are soaring—and experts say they have even more room to run   3:49 PM ET Tue, 12 March 2019 | 02:39 Four climbing FAANG stocks could be poised for an even sharper rally.  The frequently tied-together stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet are outpacing the broader market for 2019, locking in double-digit gains for the year. Two market watchers see more runway ahead of some of the names.  \\\"This week is very important,\\\" Mark Newton of Newton Advisors told CNBC's \\\"Trading Nation\\\" on Monday. All five FAANG stocks climbed higher this week as of Tuesday's close.  \\\"We have seen a longer-term breakout of the FAANG group above a downtrend that's really kept this group intact since last summer,\\\" Newton said. \\\"Many within the FAANG group have underperformed even though technology has been a decent performer, and now, that's starting to change.\\\"  The technical analyst noted that a recent uptick in investing volume for the group has driven bullish \\\"breakouts\\\" in shares of Alphabet, Facebook and Apple, which managed to break \\\"above a pretty serious range\\\" this week.  And while Newton sees further outperformance for Alphabet, Facebook and Apple, he said that, \\\"potentially, we could see others like Amazon and Netflix follow suit. So I remain bullish on technology. I think, specifically within the group, that the FAANG stocks are actually more technically appealing now than they have been in recent months. So I do like them.\\\"  S&P Global's Erin Gibbs adopted a different strategy.  \\\"I'm looking for the stocks that are actually growing earnings, that are making more money year over year and are fairly valued, and one of our favorites is Netflix,\\\" she said on \\\"Trading Nation.\\\" \\\"It's actually expected to have its profits grow above 50 percent this year. There are a lot of companies in this group, including Facebook and Apple, where profits are actually expected to contract, and they're still not trading at super-low valuations.\\\"  As such, Gibbs recommended staying away from names like Facebook and Apple, which could feel the heat of what many are calling an oncoming earnings recession.  \\\"As investors are processing this slowing economy, I'd definitely avoid those stocks that look more vulnerable and potentially could have their valuations depressed even further and focus on the really strong winners that are able to consistently grow, beat and increase their margins,\\\" Gibbs said.  Disclosure: S&P Global holds shares of Apple, Netflix and Alphabet in advised portfolios.  A year ago the FAANG stocks were a hot buy — here's where they stand heading into 2019 The tech stalwarts stumbled in 2018, amid widespread calls for regulation and industry privacy scandals. Rocky trade negotiations with China dragged the overall market lower and offered profit-taking opportunities among the highest-flying, high-valued tech stocks.

Getty Images Reed Hastings attends Reed Hastings panel during Netflix 'See What's Next' event at Villa Miani on April 18, 2018 in Rome, Italy. At the start of 2018, the so-called FAANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet — were top picks.  Four of the five tech stocks had gained roughly 50 percent the year before, excluding only Alphabet, which rose more than 30 percent in 2017. Facebook was on the heels of its best year since 2013, and Apple was having its best year since 2010.  But the tech stalwarts stumbled in 2018, amid widespread calls for regulation and industry privacy scandals. Rocky trade negotiations with China dragged the overall market lower and opened up profit-taking opportunities among the highest-flying, high-valued tech stocks.  Here's where each of the FAANG stocks stands heading into 2019:  Facebook Facebook ended the year 25 percent down for 2018, well into bear market territory. The plunge makes for Facebook's worst year of trading, and its only down year since going public in 2012.  The company hemorrhaged market valuation and investor clout as privacy scandals weighed on user metrics and the platform's ad-based business model. Facebook's top executives were grilled by Congress and raked over the coals in public domains.  Facebook will have to face questions from the FTC and ongoing challenges to its user base in 2019, leaving the stock vulnerable to more dips.  Amazon Amazon ended 2018 more than 28 percent up, making it one of the better performing FAANG stocks for the year.  The e-commerce giant continued to expand its reach into other industries, delving further into health care and media. It launched new brick-and-mortar stores to ground its retail presence. And it launched a nation-wide search for a second headquarters, ultimately announcing significant economic investments in three new locations outside of Seattle.  Amazon stock took a beating in the fourth quarter of 2018, weighed down by market turmoil and weaker than expected guidance for the holiday season. The stock has shed more than 20 percent since September.  Amazon, like Facebook, has been at the center of calls for regulation. Experts and lawmakers, including President Donald Trump, have called for antitrust reviews of the company. Any significant action on that front in 2019 could hit the stock.  Apple Apple closed almost 7 percent down for 2018, making for the stock's worst year of trading since the 2008 financial crisis. That comes after the stock passed a historic $1 trillion market cap, as the first publicly traded U.S. company to do so.  Apple now trades well below the benchmark, and at a lower valuation than Microsoft.  Apple battled uncertain sales figures and smartphone market saturation, with too little momentum in wearables and home devices to make up the difference. The stock's worst day of trading in 2018 came after its fiscal fourth quarter earnings report, during which Apple announced it would stop reporting individual unit sales and revenue figures for the iPhone and its other biggest product lines.  Apple largely avoided the scandal and regulatory pressure the other FAANG stocks felt during 2018. But its slowing growth, uncertain future and proximity to volatile stocks dragged its value lower — and could continue to do so into 2019.  Netflix Netflix outperformed its FAANG peers in 2018, gaining nearly 40 percent during the year.  The company upped its original programming spend to fend off competitors like Hulu, Amazon, HBO and the soon-to-launch Disney+ streaming service. Netflix saw success with more original TV shows and movies, across more countries, than in past years, and announced notable content partnerships.  The company continues to burn through cash, though, which could hang over the stock in 2019.  Alphabet Alphabet ended the year practically flat, down just under 1 percent in 2018.  The company suffered its own privacy and content moderation reckoning, though arguably to a lesser degree than Facebook's, and defended its business practices before Congress. Google also faced backlash from its own employees around the company's handling of misconduct and discrimination and answered to EU antitrust regulators to the tune of several billion dollars in fines.  Despite all of that, the company's ad revenue continued to grow and its \\\"Other Bets\\\" like self-driving car company Waymo made notable strides.  A minimal loss for the year, alongside painful losses among other FAANGs, could bode well for Google going into 2019.\",\n",

    "\"FAANG Stocks: Buy, Sell or Hold By Elizabeth Leary, Contributing Editor   | From Kiplinger's Retirement Report, December 2017   Getty Images  Even if you haven’t heard of the acronym, you’ve surely heard plenty about FAANG companies. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (represented by a “g” because it was formerly Google) have become darlings of the market in recent years, thanks to the companies’ seemingly limitless abilities to sustain high sales and profit growth rates. Over the past five years, the FAANG five have returned 41.6% annualized, on average, compared with a 15.8% annualized gain for Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.  But today, the shares look awfully pricey. While the S&P 500 trades for about 20 times estimated earnings for the next four quarters, FAANGs sport an average price-earnings ratio of 69.  As FAANG bears like to point out, the market has gone weak-kneed for growth stocks before, with disastrous results. In the mid 1960s, the Nifty Fifty were high-flying shares of growing companies that seemingly could do no wrong. The stocks soared to excessive price-earnings ratios into the early 1970s, then crashed and burned during the 1973–74 bear market. As Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School, has put it, the Nifty Fifty demonstrated that investors shouldn’t “pay any price” for growth.  We’re not FAANG bears, but we do think investors should approach the stocks with caution. We’ve rated each stock “buy,” “sell” or “hold.” Only one stock, Apple, merits a buy rating in our view, and even that comes with a caveat: Chances are you already hold a large position in the stock through mutual funds, so be careful not to overload your portfolio.\",\n",
    "\"Great things are expected for (most) FAANG stocks in 2019 Published: Jan 16, 2019 6:48 a.m. ET        14   The recent price declines and expected growth ahead could create big opportunities  Bloomberg Author photo By  PHILIP VAN DOORN INVESTING COLUMNIST   Did you ever think a FAANG stock might be considered a value stock?  They’re not near that level yet, but the group of large-cap technology stocks suffered during the fourth quarter of 2018, and with another year of excellent sales growth expected for most of them, you might be looking at buying opportunities.  Here’s a chart showing total returns for the FAANGs — Facebook FB, -0.17% Amazon.com AMZN, +1.01% Apple AAPL, +0.67% Netflix NFLX, -0.65%  and Google holding company Alphabet’s Class C shares GOOG, -0.65%  — since the end of 2017:  FactSet Netflix and Amazon came out well, despite the fourth-quarter pain.  Here are returns since the end of the third quarter:  FactSet Yes, they are ugly, but you might return to being a believer in some of the FAANG stocks when you see the consensus sales growth expectations. First, take a look at forward price-to-earnings valuations, based on consensus estimates for the following 12 months, for the group:  Company\tTicker\tForward P/E - Jan. 14, 2019\tForward P/E - Sept. 28, 2018\tForward P/E - Dec. 29, 2017 Facebook Inc.

However, the stock was already down 7% for 2018 through the third quarter, and the consensus earnings per estimate for the company for 2019 has declined 9% to $7.42 a share from $8.15 at the end of September.  Lofty valuations for Netflix and Amazon — paradigm shifters that always trade high to earnings — have declined significantly.  Read: Can Netflix clear a high bar of investor expectations for a change?  Apple and Alphabet have also seen big declines in forward P/E valuations. Investors weren’t surprised when Apple CEO Tim Cook explained a tremendous cut in the iPhone maker’s sales forecast on Jan. 2; the stock was down 32% during the fourth quarter (with dividends reinvested).  Price targets and ‘buy’ ratings Analysts expect double-digit share-price increases for all the FAANG stocks from these reduced levels over the next year:  FAANG company\tTicker\tClosing price - Sept. 14\tConsensus price target\tImplied 12-month upside potential\tShare 'buy' ratings Facebook Inc.

    "\"The 1 FAANG Stock to Avoid in 2019 Based on a fundamental metric, one of these is not like the rest. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Dec 28, 2018 at 7:21AM As 2018 winds to a close, it's provided an excellent reminder to the investing world that nothing goes up in a straight line. This quarter has brought with it the steepest correction in a decade and, at one point, the worst December decline in 80 years.  Then again, it's not as if investors are exactly suffering -- especially those who bought and held the FAANG stocks since their bottom in March 2009. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), have accounted for a significant portion of the Nasdaq Composite's and S&P 500's returns over the past decade.  As we look toward 2019, a reasonable case could be made for purchasing all five of these beloved tech and consumer giants. Yet, upon deeper digging, it becomes apparent that one deserves to be left on the sidelines.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaking at the F8 conference in 2016.  IMAGE SOURCE: FACEBOOK.  Catalysts aplenty for the FAANG stocks I'll be the first to admit that the FAANG stocks have plenty to offer in terms of high growth and potentially sustainable competitive advantages. Here's a brief synopsis of why each of these five companies could be set into a portfolio and potentially forgotten about for years.  Facebook: This is the king of all social media sites. Despite its recent data security concerns, Facebook has 2.27 billion monthly active users, and it owns four of the seven most popular social media platforms (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram). While there are other social media networks for users to interact, there's no platform where advertisers can reach so many eyeballs at once -- and Facebook knows this. As the company moves to further monetize Messenger and improve average revenue per user in Europe and emerging markets, its profitability could soar. Apple: The first trillion-dollar company in history, Apple is at the center of innovation. Its iPhone remains synonymous with success in the U.S., and it could be about to benefit from a tech-upgrade cycle tied to the rollout of 5G networks. And the company has many other moneymaking projects, including the iPad and Mac lines, and its Apple Music service. As the icing on the cake, Apple has a cash hoard of $237.1 billion that could, theoretically, be used to buy any of the largest publicly traded companies, except for the top 15 (three of which are part of the FAANG group). Amazon: This e-commerce giant, according to eMarketer research, was responsible for 49.1% of all e-commerce sales as of the midpoint of 2018. For context, its next-closest e-commerce competitor is eBay with 6.6% of all online sales volume. But Amazon is about more than just retail. Cloud-based Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing at just under 50% year over year, and its operating margin in the latest quarter had expanded to 31%. AWS has really become Amazon's moneymaker, and it shows no signs of slowing. Netflix: This is another company seemingly firing on all cylinders. Netflix saw a 36% increase in streaming revenue during the third quarter, with almost 7 million new subscribers, 5.87 million of which came from international markets. Netflix's addition of proprietary series and movies to complement its burgeoning content library has made it a force that other streaming providers are struggling to keep up with. Alphabet: And then there's Google, which eMarketer determined had more than 42% of the digital ad market back in 2017. Not to mention, Google's market share for search stands at an insurmountable 92.4% worldwide, according to Statcounter. Add in YouTube, the second most popular social media destination on the planet by monthly active users, and you have a company with growing influence and a rapidly expanding bottom line.

Forget about this FAANG stock in 2019 As I said, a case can be made that all five of these companies are worth buying. But heading into 2019, Wall Street and investors are considerably more focused on valuations than they've been in a long time. Thankfully, in many instances, these FAANG stocks are looking cheaper than they've been in a while.  However, analyzing FAANG stocks in a traditional way -- i.e., by examining trailing and forward P/E ratios -- typically doesn't work well. Rather, these high-growth stocks are best viewed in the context of their cash flow. The ability to generate positive cash flow from their businesses is especially important, because these are companies that really like to reinvest in future growth opportunities.  Take Facebook as an example. The social media giant is projected by Wall Street to generate $12.47 in cash flow per share (CFPS) by 2020. Over the past five years, Facebook has been valued at an average of 31.4 times its cash flow. Should this 2020 estimate prove accurate, Facebook is now valued at just under 11 times its future cash flow.  The same story is true for Amazon, which has been valued at an average of 30.4 times its cash flow over the past five years. By 2021, as AWS increases in size and the company's margins expand, its cash flow per share could hit $143. That's a future price-to-CFPS ratio of just over 10.  We see similar attractive valuations from Apple and Alphabet. Wall Street's estimated $17.09 in cash flow per share for Apple in 2020 places the tech giant at about nine times future cash flow, which is a bit below its five-year average of 11. As for Alphabet, its five-year average has been 18.1, with the company on track for $71.66 in cash flow per share by 2020. That'd work out to a future price-to-CFPS of less than 15.  A risk dial turned to its maximum setting. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.  The outlier is Netflix. Netflix has made no apologies for spending liberally on content, both proprietary and licensed, in order to bolster its domestic subscriber base, as well as lay the foundation for streaming content in international markets. Essentially, it's a spend-at-any-cost strategy to gain as many subscribers as possible.  But there's a downside to this business model. Namely, it burns through capital. Now, this isn't to say Netflix isn't well capitalized, because it is. But Netflix has been burning through its cash on hand for many years now -- and this is a trend that won't change in 2019. In fact, after losing $4 in cash flow per share in 2017, Netflix projects to lose $6.39 per share in 2018 and $5.48 per share in 2019. No one is certain when Netflix will actually begin generating positive cash flow from its business.  In a healthy market where fear is minimal, this is a statistic which could be easily overlooked. After all, Netflix is growing its subscriber base with regularity, and it maintains clear competitive advantages in the streaming space. But in a market where investors are clearly panicking, Netflix's net cash outflow is going to stick out like a sore thumb.  My suggestion: Avoid Netflix in 2019.\",\n",
    "\"FAANG Stocks Keep Rising: Is It a HODL? The tech giants had a phenomenal 2017. The FAANG stock returns for each of the five were 53%, 56%, 46%, 55% and 33% in that order. Comparatively, the stock market NASDAQ had a 28% return. Will it continue? FX Empire Editorial Board FX Empire Editorial Board FAANG What is “FAANG”? What are FAANG stocks? Is FAANG in a bubble? As FAANG stocks keep rising, is it advisable to HODL? FAANG stocks predictions Bottom line! What is “FAANG”? FAANG is the acronym given to the world’s five topmost tech stocks according to market performance and capitalization. These tech giants are Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google’s parent company).  The term FAANG is an expansion of FANG, the original acronym coined by CNBC’s Jim Cramer in 2013, but which at the time did not include Apple.  What are FAANG stocks? FAANG stocks refer to the combined stock value of the five companies that are publicly listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York. The companies are so referred because Wall Street sought to capture the impact these companies would have on the overall markets  The tech giants had a phenomenal 2017. The FAANG stock returns for each of the five were 53%, 56%, 46%, 55% and 33% in that order. Comparatively, the stock market NASDAQ had a 28% return. 2018 seems to have started on a high note with experts in agreement that two of the five are definitely a “buy” and the others a “hold”. We will have a look at what the experts are saying in our section on 2018 price outlook and prediction.  In terms of their market capitalization, the companies add up to a total of $2.5 trillion dollars.  FB $ 545 billion AMZN $607 billion AAPL$900 billion NFLX$ 94 billion GOOG$767 billion When you combine their market value, it came to about $2.5 trillion; a value many believe is roughly 15% of the entire US economy. What’s more interesting is that these five companies have a market capitalization equaling France’s economy.  Apart from their trillion- dollar worth, the spectacular growth of the FAANG companies in 2017 saw prominent investors in the US and elsewhere buy into companies like Facebook and Amazon to increase their own funds.  The FAANGs prominence comes from their growth as seen in their increased year-over-year earnings. It is this growth that has secured the tech giants’ reputation as the best company stocks for investors.  Is FAANG in a bubble? The FAANG stock market keeps on rising with its super performance for the last 4-5 years, and especially in 2017, being compared to the performance of the tech stocks that preceded the 2000 dotcom bubble burst.  There have been fears before that the tech stocks could be in a massive bubble. In June 2017, CNBC ran a commentary in which Goldman Sachs released a report on the FAANG group with a warning on valuation and concerns that the tech giants’ volatility had by then become extraordinarily too low.  However, Goldman’s report explained that the FAANG stocks have certain advantages over the tech firms in the 2000 dotcom bubble burst. It noted that the stocks of the five companies have a better cash flow, cash balances, and valuation.  Furthermore, analysts note that there is a big difference between today’s tech giants and those of the dotcom era that went burst. For instance, UBS points out those current trends in spheres like social media, e-commerce, cloud computing and machine learning gave the FAANG group a lot more room to wiggle because these are areas that are yet to be fully explored.  However, there are still fears out there that what we are witnessing are signs of a bubble. Alberto Gallo, of Algebris Investments, has a belief that $2.5 trillion tech-titans’ valuation and irrational behavior points out to a possible bubble. In his valuation assessment, he points out the stock pricing and unlimited earnings as bad indicators.  Although extremely loved by investors, the tech giants can’t be considered flawless.  Goldman analysts have noted that if there was low volatility, people would end up underestimating the inherent risks that include cyclical exposure, antitrust concerns or potentially, regulations that targeted online activities. The analysts have said that momentum in the FAANG group has seemingly built a kind of “valuation air pocket” leading to “cause for pause”.  In fact, Gallo ranks FAANG 6th on his list of top 10 bubbles to happen in the near future, meanwhile, Bitcoin bubble is ranked 5th.  More importantly, as the FAANG bears put it, growth stocks markets have been there before.  While many believe this won’t happen, it is noted by many experts that FAANG cannot lead the market forever. In fact, European tech firms just unveiled plans to de-FAANG the dominance of the US tech giants.  Now, compare that with the fast-rising cryptocurrency landscape where altcoins like Ethereum and Litecoin among others, look set to overtake Bitcoin, BTC and the FAANG share one very clear characteristic: they have completely dominated their respective fields. For instance, Bitcoin is the benchmark in the cryptocurrency market, and every one of the more than 1400 crypto coins aims to be better than Bitcoin. Less than 5% of the myriad cryptocurrencies will eventually go on to be big. Analysts have compared the FAANG stocks and how they dominate NASDAQ to what one or two altcoins would do in the crypto technology should Bitcoin burst.  Having said that, it is clear that the tech stocks of the five companies have picked up in 2018 where they left off in 2017. All, except Apple, are in positive territory.  For the last five years, the FAANG stocks have had an annualized return of 41%, compared to 16% return posted for the S&P’s 500. And the trend seems to be the same in 2018.  As FAANG stocks keep rising, is it advisable to HODL? Hodling originated from a 2013 BitcoinTalk thread by a user named GameKyuubi. It basically means you sit tight on your stock even when the market trends indicate otherwise. When a stock value drops, a hodler rides the wave and avoids losing the stack by getting into emotional day trading. FAANG sticks had a remarkable bull run in 2017. Even if the bears are gearing up for the worst, 2018 figures indicate that the stocks are yet to hit ATHs. So, it is a HODL.  FAANG stocks predictions 2017 is behind us and the big question right now is where these companies will go in 2018 and beyond. Already, indications are that FAANG is off to a great start in 2018. Analysts had put valuations for the S&P 500 Index at 18.5 to 19.0 times as the expectation in per-share earnings. However, it is important for the investor to note that analysts are a bit cautious when calling the FAANG predictions. It is anticipated that the uptrend will be slow, but will surely pick up over time.  Apple Inc. Apple is the biggest of the five FAANG. Apple’s stock is trading at a modest 15 forward price-to-earnings multiple against this year’s expected earnings. Apple has a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 19. Market analysts are saying that they expect Apple to actually return 6.90% to investors for the year. There is also a prediction for there to be a return of 1.45% in the form of dividends, so that comes to roughly 8.35% for the year.  The 52-week trading range is at a target of $118.21 to $177.20. If you look at that, you realize the predictions are pretty robust for Apple Inc. with a market cap of $900; Apple is the top-ranked company on the S&P 500 Index.  Facebook For Facebook, the stock trade is put at a 28 forward P/E multiply projected earnings for 2018. Furthermore, analysts give it a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 36. In terms of the price targets, industry experts have a consensus $210.79 as its price target.  Analysts are also looking at Facebook returning 12% to investors by close of the year.  Facebook’s 52-week trade range is put at $ 124.84 to $ 188.90 and that the social media giant has a market capitalization of $546 billion that is expected to grow. At the moment, Facebook is ranked 5th on the S&P 500 Index. Except for something unforeseen, Facebook’s growth is expected to have an uptrend in 2018.  Netflix Netflix is the smallest company of the big five. Netflix’s stocks are trading with a 93 forward price-to-earnings multiple against its 2018 expected earnings. The company has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 212. Stock market analysts are giving a prediction of Netflix returning about 2 percent to investors in 2018. This figure is based on the targeted consensus price of $217.70.  Netflix has a 52-week trading range put at $128.50 – $213.64. The current market cap of $94 billion is expected to grow in 2018 with increased subscriptions.  Amazon.com Amazon’s stock is trading with a 156 forward price-to-earnings multiple against the 2018 market expected earnings. Market analysts have given it a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of about 320. With its robust business strategy, experts have called that Amazon will yield a 4% return on investments for its investors in 2018.this is based on the target of $1,300.87.  Amazon’s 52-week trading range is put at $799.50- $1,259.33, which is pretty good for any investor. It is expected that Amazon’s market cap of $607 billion will grow to keep it position four on the S&P 500.  Google (Alphabet) The company is ranked 2nd on the S&P 500 Index. The company has two stock listings on the market; GOOG and GOOGL. Alphabet’s GOOGL stock is trading with a projected 26 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple against its 2018 expected earnings.  Analysts predict a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of about 37. As such, experts are calling for Google (Alphabet) to break even during 2018’s trading period. The predictions are based on a target of $1,100.86.  When we look at the yearly trading range, Alphabet has a 52-week range with a target of $790.52 to $1,111.27 The Ad giant has a market capitalization of $769 billion, which is expected to grow when the company rolls out its self-driving cars.  Bottom line! There is a lot that suggests that FAANG may see another bull run in 2018. Experts believe all five are yet to achieve their “ATH”. So, if you are looking to sell, now would not be the best time to do so.\",\n",
    "\"What are FAANG Stocks? FAANGs are nothing but stocks listed in the New York Stock Exchange for the companies –  Start Your Free Investment Banking Course  Download IB Excel Templates, Accounting, Valuation, Financial Modeling, Video Tutorials Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google  When we talk about stocks, what comes to our mind is – stock markets, companies trading into these, ups and downs of indices and risks and returns.  When you hear the term “FAANG stocks”, what comes to your mind?  These companies were normally trading until mid-2017 when people started recognizing the drastic movements in the markets and indices. They found that these companies are huge enough; and as they constitute the major composition of the NYSE, that the Wall Street and CNBC grouped them together, and started calling them – the FAANG stocks. They make up around 12.0% of the S&P 500 Index.  Some Facts about the FAANG Stocks Tickers for these companies on the NASDAQ and their current prices trending are:  FAANGs Stocks of company NASDAQ  *Market Prices of Stocks as on Oct 2, 2018 4:00 PM (source: Yahoo Finance) **Market capitalization in $ Bil(s) for the FY 2017 (source: Yahoo Finance) ***Data as on Oct 2, 2018 4:00 PM (source: Yahoo Finance) Thus, it is seen that of the total volume of 2,297,504,561 (2.3 billion) reported by the nasdaqtrader.com as on Oct 1, 2018, total volumes traded for the FAANG stocks is 73,489,363 (72 million). Additionally, the total Market Capitalization for NASDAQ is approximately $30 Tn (reported by nasdaq.com on Jan 2018), while these stocks alone make up $3,531.72 Bn (or $3.5 Tn) as on Oct 2, 2018, which is ~10.0% of the nation’s total market cap.  How FAANG Stocks Affect the Indices? As seen in the above analysis, FAANG stocks take up a huge chunk of the market cap in the exchanges, which is why movement in such stocks affects the whole index. It can be well understood that although being just a handful of stocks if they hold good market strength, they are a good enough to make or shake the indices. They affect not only their own shareholders but also the entire shareholder strength.  Are FAANG Stocks Risky? Since they hold a major share in total stock prices, an investor needs to invest quite a good amount to purchase the FAANGs. They are part of the best investments for investors since over a period of time they have evolved very well and paid good returns. However, investing in this portfolio alone seems risky. All the FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) are a part of the tech industry. Portfolio investments have a basic concept to diversify the risks to gain maximum returns. Thus, investing only into these stocks may bring good returns as these companies grow, but just if there is any major event or slowdown, these stocks can together bring total losses. Most of the major investment firms and mutual funds have a combination of these stocks and other smaller stocks, which help them to diversify their portfolio. Investing otherwise, each of these stocks requires a good amount of money, hence an investor first needs to arrange to buy such stocks. If in case these do not give expected returns in future due to any event, the investor would lose quite some wealth of his after these stocks. Hence, it is advisable to diversify their portfolios. Another important point which should be noted is that since these giants are the best in their fields, they create a monopoly in the market. There is hardly any competition for them, which is why they may rule the market. They may grow really powerful in near future. Investing in these stocks may seem to be a wise decision now, but the future gets insecure. Some Key Points to Remember While Trading into FAANGs Investing in the FAANG stocks is nothing wrong; however, one needs to be cautious into their investments. Some points to be noted are as below:  #1 – Diversification of the portfolio is very important: If the investor deals into individual stocks, it becomes a primary reason for him to hedge his risks related to these stocks. The FAANGs can be giving quite good returns for a while, but the markets are very volatile, and the risky nature cannot be ignored.  #2 – Regular study of the markets to track performances: The investor should not be under a notion that these stocks will always be paying well. A good investor is a well-informed research analyst, and only by the regular track of movement of stocks and the market, can he expect good returns.  #3 – Be balanced: This means investing in other industries and markets as well. Investing in FAANGs is like investing in the only tech industry, and diversification is required not only with other stocks of the same industry but also with other industries. With FAANGs, an investor would be sitting on one side of the boat, if there is too much weight on his side, his boat may topple downwards. So, he needs a perfect balance. There are a lot of analytical tools which provide good information about the portfolio’s beta factor for diversification.  Conclusion Thus, it is seen that grass is not always green on the other side. One can definitely go ahead on the other side towards the greener grass by investing into the FAANGs but needs to keep in mind about the risks it involves. Additionally, only he is not the one who can read these stocks. There are millions of other investors who have the same reading about these FAANG stocks and market sentiments. So, there is a lot of competition, and there are a lot of good players who are well aware of how to make money. Hence, it becomes extremely important to understand the markets well; and not just go by projected growth or returns declared.  Recommended Articles This has been a guide to what are FAANG Stocks?
